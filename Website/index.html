    <h1>Payments Made Easy</h1>
    <p>This is an app, you can use to buy or purchase airtime & Data plans, you can also use to pay bills and make transfers, you can also use this app to know if the transfer made was Fake (scam), you can use your Qruzcoin to purchase Cash, coins or tokens for your mobile games. you can play games and win prices on the app to easily generate your account. You'll get free 500Qcoin(₦100) for your first time signing up or joining the waitlist. The app is still under development so we'll need your Patience and support as you help us reach out to your friends and family to know more about Qruzpay. We want to make Qruzpay available in all countries but as this is a project in progress, it will only be available in Nigeria for the time being. <br> Note : It's optional to choose your Qcoin as a payment option, Debit/Credit Card or Bank account. If you don't have bank account we have an option to use your local airtime as a payment method. Thank you for the love and support #thematic</p>
